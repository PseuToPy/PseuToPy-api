# PseuToPy

PseuToPy is a web application that allows programming beginners to learn to
program using pseudocode written in their native tongues. In this way, you c    an
write small programs using the language that you are most familiar with and
don't necessarily need to be comfortable with the English language (which is
used by the most popular programming languages).

This web application is based on the Python package with the same name. You     can
find it on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pseutopy/), or on
[GitHub](https://github.com/PseuToPy/PseuToPy).

For more information on PseuToPy, or to try it out, you should visit the
